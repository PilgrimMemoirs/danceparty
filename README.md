# House Parrrrtay!!!

So it's like the weekend and you're obvi super popular. Throw a house party and impress all the cool cats with your new Jquery and Github skilllzzzz! 
Make all your friends appear when you push the 'invite friends' button or leave when you push the 'kick out friends' button. 

##Instructions
First you'll need to use what we learned on Thursday to get a local copy of the these files from my github repo. If any of this process is foggy, Google it! Github has fantastic documentation!

1.Start by forking this Repo

2.Copy the repo url

3.run 'git clone url_here' with the repo's url (make sure you're in the directory you want these files saved in.)

4. Work your Jquery Magic! The files will now be cloned locally for you to work on! Just cd into the directory and have at it! 

### When Challenge is complete

1. Run your git add, git commit and git push commands

2. Submit a pull request!




#### Extra (optional) challenge: 
Add a new button that invites friends one by one. This will require some extra research with Jquery and Javascript. Hint: Might want to checkout how to select elements at random.
